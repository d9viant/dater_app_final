# Dater - A tinder clone

A tinder clone built using core Java/JavaFX and MySQL with additional APIs. It is structured in a three layer fashion consisting of client/common/server parts. I've Implemented a basic representation of the ELO Matchmaking system, an open source map library which utilizes BingMaps with the addition of the GeoLoc2Lite library to provide a basic system which tracks the address through the IP address on the network. Implementations of certain Design Patterns and multi-thread concurrency concepts are present.

Java Libraries used:

https://www.sothawo.com/projects/mapjfx/ - JavaFX Project for Map Implementations using only Core Java

https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/ - A free geolocation database which points towards an street address using the user IP

https://www.daniel-braun.com/technik/reverse-geocoding-library-for-java/ - A reverse geolocation https://www.openstreetmap.org/ API which returns the address details for the LAN and LONG passed attributes

JavaFX libraries used:

The project is still in the works and some things may change, I will make an update in due time!
